# Introduction

This is a fourth project for Udacity Front-End Nanodegree Program. It is based on the learning of javaScript testing framework [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) and is a web-based application that reads RSS feeds.


## Importance

Testing is an important part of the development process and many organizations practice a standard of development known as "test-driven development". This is when developers write tests first, before they ever start developing their application. All the tests initially fail and then they start writing application code to make these tests pass.

Whether you work in an organization that uses test-driven development or in an organization that uses tests to make sure future feature development doesn't break existing features, it's an important skill to have!
